## Objects and Arrays:

- An Array is a type of Object that has some methods already attached to it.
- Property string can be passed with dot notation or square brackets in quotes. `['thing']`
- using dot notation coerces to a string whereas bracket doesn’t
- dot notation can only be used with characters that are accepted in a variable name. eg can’t use - or 435
- array is a special kind of object. gives access to certain methods eg. `push(), .splice()` etc.  The most special thing about an array is the `.length `property. This is a property that is computed as you add numerical indexes
- we can use dot notation for strings. We can use `[]` for strings, numbers, variables, weird characters and expressions(e.g. 2+2)
- So why use dot notations? we use dot notation because it saves characters.
